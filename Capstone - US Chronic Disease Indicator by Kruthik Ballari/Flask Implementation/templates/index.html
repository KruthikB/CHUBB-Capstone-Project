    <br>
    <p>The US Chronic Disease Indicator (CDI) Dataset is a comprehensive dataset 
        that contains information on the prevalence and incidence of chronic diseases and 
        associated risk factors in the United States. It is often used for public health 
        research and analysis. The dataset includes various indicators such as the rates of diabetes, 
        heart disease, obesity, and other chronic conditions, as well as demographic data like age, sex, 
        race, and socioeconomic status.
        The CDI dataset is typically compiled from multiple sources, including the Behavioral Risk Factor 
        Surveillance System (BRFSS) and other health surveys. Researchers and public health officials use it to analyze trends, 
        identify health disparities, and develop strategies for prevention and intervention. 
        It helps in understanding how chronic diseases impact different communities and informs policy-making to improve public health outcomes
